## Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Currently, I have completed the following milestones that help to build this project:

Milestone 1: Setting up the Environment 
- This was the first step where I set up the Github repository

Milestone 2: Creating the variables for the game
- Using conditions and the users input. Once an answer is input there is a validation check

Milestone 3: Check that that guessed characters are in the word
- Checking that the guessed letter is actually inside of the word.

Milestone 4: Creating the game class
- Using OOP to develop the Hangman game
